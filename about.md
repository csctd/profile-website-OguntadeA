# About Me

<p>I have many interests in my life. I'm always working on new things and trying my best to live my life to the fullest. I always wanted to travel and make money. I've grown to have a great interest in computer science and the technical industry. I also have a love for true crime. I've always wanted a hobby that wasn't online therefore I looked into punch needling. I've grown to love it and make money off of it. I am very family and friends oriented and I take the initiative to prioritize them in my life. I want to enjoy life to the fullest and see the world.</p>
